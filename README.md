### **Introduction**

As part of our collaborative project, we have successfully created our own library that includes the core C++ container classes:
- `vector`;
- `array`;
- `list`;
- `queue`;
- `stack`;
- `map`;
- `set`.

Our implementation provides a complete set of standard methods and attributes needed for element handling, container occupancy checking, and iteration. Moreover, we solved an additional task involving the implementation of several less common, but nevertheless important details of container classes from the C++ standard library. The whole project is a joint effort.
